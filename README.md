**Machine Downtime Analysis**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring factors influencing machine downtime, specifically focusing on machine failures. The analysis is based on a dataset provided for an internship at 360DigiTMG.

**Project Highlights:**

* **Data exploration and cleaning:** The notebook imports the data, performs initial analysis, and handles missing values.
* **Visualization and feature engineering:** Time series plots, failure rates, correlation heatmaps, and a binary downtime feature are created for analysis.
* **Statistical analysis:** T-tests (code included) compare metrics between failure and non-failure groups. Correlations between numerical features and machine failure are calculated.
* **Bivariate analysis:** Scatter plots visualize the relationship between features and machine failure.
* **Time series analysis:** Monthly machine failure rates are analyzed for potential seasonal patterns.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**

* Data wrangling and cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Data visualization (time series, heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots)
* Statistical analysis (t-tests, correlation coefficients)
* Feature engineering
* Proficiency in Jupyter Notebook

**Running the Notebook**

1. Install required libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy).
2. Open the `Machine_Downtime_Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the code cells sequentially.

**Dependencies:**

* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scipy
